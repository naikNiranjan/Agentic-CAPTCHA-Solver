## ü§ñ Choosing Your Models

Agentic CAPTCHA Solver allows you to configure different LLM models for each agent to balance performance and cost. Here are recommended configurations:

### Better Performance
- **Planner & Validator**: 
  - Better reasoning and planning capabilities
  - More reliable CAPTCHA analysis
- **Navigator**: 
  - Efficient for web navigation tasks
  - Good balance of performance and cost

### Cost-Effective Configuration
- **Planner & Validator**: 
  - Reasonable performance at lower cost
  - May require more iterations for complex CAPTCHAs
- **Navigator**: 
  - Lightweight and cost-efficient
  - Suitable for basic navigation tasks

### Local Models
- **Setup Options**:
  - Use Ollama or other custom OpenAI-compatible providers to run models locally
  - Zero API costs and complete privacy with no data leaving your machine



## üéØ Core Modules and Functional Flow

### 1. CAPTCHA Input Module
**Function**: Accepts CAPTCHA inputs from real-world applications or manually uploaded samples.

**Types Supported**:
- **Text-based CAPTCHAs**: Distorted alphanumeric images, mathematical problems, simple questions
- **Image-based CAPTCHAs**: Object identification (e.g., "click all bicycles"), pattern matching, visual puzzles
- **Audio-based CAPTCHAs**: Speech-to-text decoding, audio pattern recognition
- **Interactive CAPTCHAs**: Click-based verification, drag and drop puzzles, slider challenges

### 2. AI-Based Solver Engine
**Function**: Uses LLMs and specialized AI tools to attempt solving CAPTCHAs.

**Approach**:
- **OCR APIs and custom models** for text CAPTCHAs
- **Computer vision models** (CLIP, SAM, YOLO) for image CAPTCHAs
- **Speech-to-text models** (Whisper, Google Speech API) for audio CAPTCHAs
- **LLMs** for understanding CAPTCHA instructions and complex reasoning

### 3. Logging & Evaluation System
**Function**: Tracks each CAPTCHA solving attempt and records:
- Input type and complexity level
- Solved/failed status with detailed analysis
- Time taken and confidence metrics
- CAPTCHA characteristics (distortion, complexity, security features)
- **Outcome**: Transparent tracking of AI performance across CAPTCHA types

### 4. Security Analysis Engine
**Function**: Assesses CAPTCHA resilience using AI-solving results and security metrics.

**Analysis Metrics**:
- Success rate vs complexity correlation
- Time-to-break analysis and performance benchmarks
- False positive/negative behavior patterns
- Entropy and variation in challenge generation
- **AI Assist**: LLMs generate natural language analysis and risk commentary

### 5. Security Scoring System
**Function**: Assigns numeric security scores (0‚Äì100) based on:
- Resistance to AI solving attempts
- Variation and unpredictability in generation
- Multimodal complexity and security features
- **Method**: Weighted scoring using solving statistics and security heuristics

### 6. Recommendations Generator
**Function**: Automatically suggests CAPTCHA design improvements using LLM analysis.

**Examples**:
- "Use randomized word distortions with noise overlays"
- "Replace static audio with dynamically generated speech including accents"
- "Increase object diversity in image-based CAPTCHAs"
- "Implement partial object occlusion and ambiguous boundaries"

## üîê Real-World Application Testing & Ethics

**Scope**: Test publicly available CAPTCHAs in sandboxed environments or controlled research settings.

**Ethics**:
- Follow responsible disclosure guidelines for any vulnerabilities discovered
- Focus on academic security analysis and research, not exploitation
- Respect website terms of service and implement appropriate rate limiting
- Contribute findings to the security research community for CAPTCHA improvements

## üìä Security Analysis Outputs

The extension generates comprehensive security analysis reports including:

- **Security scorecards** per CAPTCHA type with detailed metrics
- **PDF/CSV reports** summarizing analysis findings and recommendations
- **AI-generated design recommendations** for enhanced CAPTCHA security
- **Performance benchmarks** comparing AI solving effectiveness across CAPTCHA types
- **Vulnerability assessments** with specific improvement suggestions

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All CAPTCHA solving and analysis happens in your browser
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or store any personal information or CAPTCHA data
- **API Key Security**: Your LLM API keys are stored locally and never transmitted to our servers
- **Research Ethics**: Built-in safeguards ensure responsible security research practices
